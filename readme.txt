== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does the plugin work with any WordPress theme? =

Your theme is rather a container and styling mechanism for blocks. We made sure Getwid blocks maximum inherit default styles from your theme - unless you add your own styles! Getwid is also tested with the Twenty Nineteen theme - they are a great couple.

Your content will be displayed in a simplified format; it'll get back to the initial look after you reactivate Getwid.

= Are Getwid blocks translation-ready? =

Yes. The plugin works with major translation plugins.

Yes. By default Getwid uses Font Awesome icons but you can [add your own ones](https://gist.github.com/mototeam/0072b6d064ae90afd15ecba8dfca366c).

= Can I change the "Recent Posts" block layout? =

Yes. Copy this file: `\getwid\includes\templates\recent-posts\post.php` to `{your_theme}\getwid\recent-posts\`.
